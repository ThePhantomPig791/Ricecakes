# Rice Cakes
## A ~1.19 Fabric mod adding rice, rice farming, rice cakes, rice paintings, and other silly rice-related things to Minecraft!

_Requires Fabric API_

_Works on 1.19, 1.19.1, and 1.19.2, don't let the file name deceive you!_


Oryza Sativa Plant:
A new crop, grown from the Oryza Sativa seeds, which you can find in savanna village chests. By planting and growing the Oryza Sativa seeds (I'm just going to call them 'rice seeds' from now on), you can harvest Rough Rice, a type of raw and unprocessed rice that isn't meant for eating.

Brown & White Rice:
The focus of this mod! Brown rice can be obtained by putting rough rice in a crafting table, and white rice can be crafted the same way, simply by putting brown rice into the grid.

Fried Rice:
A hearty meal crafted with carrots, an egg, a potato, brown rice, and a bowl. Be sure not to eat it raw, as you might get food sickness!

Rice Cakes:
~~Roll credits!~~ The name of the mod! Rice cakes are also a super filling meal! So filling, in fact, that they might even heal you when you eat them! They're crafted with 7 white rice, a milk bucket, and an egg, but like the fried rice, make sure not to eat it raw!

### Okay, now into the more crazy stuff...

Rice Helmet:
I guess this one is also a fulfilling meal? You can wear it on your head (obviously), so whenever you get hungry, just take a bite! Crafted with 4 rice and a rice cake (in the shape of a helmet).

Rice Cake Block:
This one is, uh, 9 entire fulfilling meals!? If one rice cake might heal you a little bit, I wonder what eating this would do...

Rainbow Rice:
Crafted by surrounding a white rice in various dyes, this type of rice will literally make you glow! (Tip: want someone else to literally glow? Just force-feed them a rainbow rice! Works every time! :D)

Rice Paintings:
I'm not going to show any pictures of the mod's three paintings, you'll need to try it and find them yourself :smirk:
To get you started, one of them is a 1x1, one of them is a 1x20, and one of them is a 6x6. GL!



## And that's everything that this little mod adds! I hope you enjoy snacking on some rice cakes ;)

__Thank you to Chris7898 for requesting the mod/coming up with some of the ideas!__
(And this is my first mod, so try not to be too harsh, but if you find any bugs, please report them on the github repository [you can get to it by pressing the little "source" button next to the "files" button] and I'll try my best to fix them [the same goes for feature requests, too!])
